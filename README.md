# Arduino Motor

This arduino project is inspired by the "Arduino Projects Book" project 9 by Scogg Fitzgerald and Michael Shiloh. This project uses a 9-volt battery to power a small motor. When using a 9-volt battery, it is important to be cautious about backflow electricity. Backflow electricity can pipeline backwards in a circit and overload circits. This project will show you how to propery use a motor with an Arunino Uno.
